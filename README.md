**screencmd** is a plugin for the [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) IRC client. It allows execution of commands when irssi's [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) instance is attached and detached. For example, you may want to disable certain types of messages or disable autoscroll when the screen instance is detached.

Usage
-------
To install, simply copy `screencmd.pl` to your irssi scripts directory and load it with `/script load screencmd.pl`. For further usage instructions, refer to `screencmd.pl`.
